# Gateway

The Import Flow gets information from an API as well as the Export Flow sends data to another API. For communicating with those APIs, Cenit needs to know where to send the request, that is, the API base URL and one of its methods. The API URL and the method make up the endpoint,  the whole URL where the request is sent. Moreover, a flow should ask for permission to access that resource. The [Security Section](security/security.md) explains  how to configure all the elements related to the authorization process.

This section explains how Cenit makes possible the communication with other APIs by configuring [Connections](gateway/connection.md) and [Resources](gateway/resources.md).

The Gateway Menu allows to define all the elements related to the communication between Cenit and other APIs.
