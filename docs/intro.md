# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Cenit IO in less than 5 minutes**.

[Cenit](https://app.cenit.io) is a 100% open source integration Platform (iPaaS) which is modern, powerful, yet hackable to the core, ready to use in the cloud [Cenit-UI - Integration Platform as a Service](https://app.cenit.io) or on-premise. It has been designed to solve unique integration needs, orchestrate data flows that may involve different types of protocols and data formats, and provide API management capabilities. All of these features enable Cenit to support a wide range of integration use cases. It is particularly valuable to embrace a pervasive integration approach.

For an overview about how to orchestrate a basic integration in Cenit, you should read the [Basic Integration](tutorials/basic_integration.md) section.
